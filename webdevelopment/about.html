      <h3>About me</h3>

      <p>
        I am a student-athlete here in <em>Mizzou</em>. I came here because the
        university is gorgeous, and the swim team was an excellent fit for what
        I was looking for.<br />
        <br />I originally lived in Russia for the first 11 years, until moving
        to Oklahoma and eventually getting to <em>Mizzou</em>. I do many things
        outside of swimming and school in <em>Mizzou</em>. I love to draw and
        read. <b>Dostoevsky</b> writes some of my favorite books, as well as
        <b>Albert Camus</b>. I fell in love with drawing recently, and my
        artwork could be better, but still, it is something that I'm very much
        invested in. It's something that I want to get good at at one point in
        my life. I'm a senior at <em>Mizzou</em>, so I only have a little time
        left here as a student-athlete; I will be moving on to pursue my
        endeavors in drawing, and hopefully, it will be something that I will do
        professionally in my life. I am pursuing a bachelorâ€™s in educational
        studies, and I am estimated to graduate in May 2025. <br /><br />My
        favorite quote is
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        "Our thoughts control our feelings, and our feelings control our
        actions."
      </blockquote>
