     Hello World! My name is Daniel, and I am a student-athlete here in Mizzou. I came here because the university is gorgeous, and the swim team was a great fit for what I was looking for. I originally lived in Russia for the first 11 years of my life, until moving to Oklahoma and eventually getting to Mizzou. I do many things outside of swimming and school in Mizzou. I love to draw and read. Dostoevski writes some of my favorite books, as well as Albert Camus. I fell in love with drawing recently, and my artwork isn't all that great, but still, it is something that I'm very much invested in. It's something that I really want to get good at at one point in my life. I'm a senior at Mizzou, so I don't have much time left here as a student-athlete; I will be moving on to pursue my endeavors in drawing, and hopefully, it will be something that I will do professionally in my life.
